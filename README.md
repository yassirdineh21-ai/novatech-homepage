## 📝 Full Project Description
This project is my final milestone submission for the **Web Development with AI** class at **Highline College**. The goal was to create a fully designed homepage using HTML and CSS that meets the requirements for a complete web layout.

The Novatech homepage is designed as a landing page for a fictional tech product. It features a bold hero section, organized feature highlights, and a footer. I used Flexbox, spacing, and consistent color themes to give the page a professional, modern look. All styling is done in a separate CSS file, and the site structure follows proper semantic HTML.

This project meets all rubric requirements:
- A complete homepage layout  
- CSS styling for all sections  
- Navbar and footer included  
- Images or icons  
- Feature section / main content  
- Clear visual hierarchy  
- Mobile-friendly layout
